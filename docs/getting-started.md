# Getting Started

## Review Updated Syllabus

Please take some time to review the [Learn Angular](https://skillsoft.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/IntTeamDrive/Shared%20Documents/Curriculum/2.%20Curriculum%20Development/Domains/Web%20Development/Courses%20and%20Skill%20Paths/Angular%20(2024)/%5BAngular%5D%20Syllabus.xlsx?d=wa1c129b033f3432db3c1e941630b0b19&csf=1&web=1&e=D9Mvvy) syllabus. We will be creating content for the new Learn Angular course. This will require the creation of new articles, quizzes, projects, and lessons. 

## Review the Workflow Document

Next, please go through the [workflow document](workflow.md) to set up the Github repo and get familiar with the tools that we will use during production.
