#### Introduction

* Introduce yourself: Begin with a brief introduction of who you are. For example: "Hi, I'm Nhi, a full-stack developer from California."

* Introduce the topic: Clearly state the topic and its relevance. For example: "In this lesson/video, we'll talk about Server Components, a React feature that enables rendering components on the server."

* Overview of the Lesson (if applicable): Provide a brief outline of what viewers can expect to learn in the video, highlighting key points or skills that will be covered.


> The following topics can be included to help you craft your video.

#### Topic #1: Definition

Provide a clear definition of the topic discussed, ensuring that learners have a strong foundation for understanding the rest of the video.

#### Topic #2: Visual Representation of Topic

Break down and explain the visual representation of the topic. This could include diagrams, charts, or other visual aids that enhance understanding via your art request. 

#### Topic #3: Code Examples

Provide a high-level example of the topic in action via code example. You can use a tool like [carbon.sh](https://carbon.now.sh/) to create well-formatted screenshots of your code. Using the "a11y dark" theme is recommended for accessibility considerations.

#### Topic #4: Preview Lesson Codebase

If your lesson has a consistent codebase that learners build on throughout the exercises, provide a preview of the application. Discuss how it implements the concept introduced in the video, and explain that learners will be building it piece by piece. 

This is a great way to add a "hook" to incentivize learners to complete the lesson.

#### Conclusion
