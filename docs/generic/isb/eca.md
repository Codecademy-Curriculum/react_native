## Author

In Author, an ECA is created via the Assessment content item and selecting the Coding Question Assessment Type. 

In Attributes, set the following:
* Layout Components: 
* Workspace: 

Then work by clicking "Edit Workspace."

The initial and final savepoints can be saved via the navigation panel. 

Note that learners can only see one file (and not navigate to any other files), so all the relevant information must be in one file for them to work on. If additional information is in other files (such as how a component is being used), put that information in the narrative. Unfortunately, we cannot let learners preview the application because there isn't a Web Component, Terminal, and Browser layout.

To view how the ECA looks to learners, remove `authoring=true` from the URL in the preview. 

## Metadata

* Module Name: [name of the module the ECA is related to]
* Learning Outcome: [name of the learning objective this ECA is designed to test]
* Workspace type: [name of the workspace type]
* Workspace layout: [configuration of workspace layout]

## Narrative

This question is assessing your ability to...

**Requirements and Assumptions:**
* some restriction...
* something has to be like this...
* something has been provided...

## ECA Starter Code

Provide the starter code for the ECA. Remember that learners cannot navigate through different files for the ECA, so tested content must be in one file. 


## ECA Final Code

Provide the final code for the ECA. 

## ECA Test

Follow the following format for test outputs, when applicable: 
* “Expected X to be Y” format, not the usual “Did you …?”  
* “Expected use of [syntax].” 
* “Failed test [X]. Expected: [A], Actual: [B].” 

Provide the test to be used for the ECA.
