# Review Cards

_Read the [content standards](http://curriculum-documentation.codecademy.com/Content-Standards/review-card/) for expectations on writing review cards._

Important points from the content standards:

* A Review Card is presented to learners to help them review a learning standard they encountered in the last lesson they completed. 
* Review cards contain two elements: a text block and a code block.
  * A code block is not necessary if the learning standard is not about a particular function, variable, code structure. If it is about a concept, it is enough to describe the concept itself.
* The text should fully describe the learning standard and the code block should show an example of the code covered by the learning standard.
* Review cards are presented to a learner as part of Practice Packs and Cheat Sheets.

Review Cards examples:

* [Learn React](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101/modules/react-101-jsx-u/cheatsheet)
* [Learn A-Frame](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-a-frame/modules/learn-a-frame-introduction/cheatsheet)
* [Learn JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript/modules/learn-javascript-introduction/cheatsheet)

## Process

Review cards will be tracked with the [Review Cards List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v7HfK7hncNjakgQNxi_gB_BBi2-HdvkI2soMcboW8rI/edit#gid=237354876) Google spreadsheet. 

The spreadsheet contains list of Learning Standards with their URLs in Author per lesson in separate tabs. The purpose of the review cards are to make learning standards learner-facing, meaning that they essentially are learning standards rewritten with relavant code examples to help learners review the key topics covered in each lesson.

1. Create a Review Card content under Practice Content in Author.
2. Give the review card a title that summarizes what the review card is about.
3. Review Card slug should start with `p5js-` followed by the title of the review card.
4. Add yourself to Credited Authors
5. Add Learning Standard by searching its UUID in the search field (the series of numbers and letters followed by `https://author.codecademy.com/learning-standards/` in the learning standard URL).
6. Edit the learning standards to be learner-friendly in the Review Text field.
7. Add URL of the Review Card in the [Review Cards List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v7HfK7hncNjakgQNxi_gB_BBi2-HdvkI2soMcboW8rI/edit#gid=237354876) spreadsheet.
8. Add your name in the Author of Review Card column of the spreadsheet.
9. Change Status to "In Progress" when you start working on the review card, and change it to "In Review" when you are done.
